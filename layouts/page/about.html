        <p>Ivan and I prepared a nice IoT workshop. We’ll setup Jenkins on a Raspberry Pi, which will act as local CI server. We'll create a Jenkins job to run PHP Unit tests on our code, hosted on GitHub. Then, we’ll use NodeMCU connected to a gesture detection sensor to start the Jenkins job. Raspberry Pi will produce different sounds if job was successful or not (if PHPUnit tests pass or fail).</p>

        <p>The JavaScript landscape is filled with great many frameworks. Is Vue JS just another tool in the box, more of the same? Or does it bring something worthy of choosing it for your next project? Vue is far from being the only newcomer in the area of JavaScript frameworks, but its simple approach to common problems has conquered the hearts and minds of many developers, and really fast! Let's explore what makes Vue so great, and how it compares to giants such as Google's Angular and Facebook's React.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is probably the most popular programming language in the world. But it’s also the most misunderstood one.
