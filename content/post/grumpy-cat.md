## Sublime Linter Cat Gutter Theme


I installed a plugin in Sublime text that shows a scared or angry cat in the gutter of the lines where you have lint errors. It's awesome having such a little quirky bit while doing your regular programming thing.

Grumpy Cat!

Sometimes you get angry at the cat, sometimes you get happy when you see it. But, that's life, man.
