[NišJS](https://nisjs.com) is a local JS meetup in Niš, Serbia - my hometown. I was sad that Nis didn't have it's JavaScript meetups like other cool cities. But then I realized - why not do something about it?! So I did. And it feels really great, to get up and do something that matters to (some) people!

We have over 160 members after one month of starting the initiative.
